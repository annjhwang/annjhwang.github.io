		My conscientiousness: 80%

		Nature's Influence: Father is an extremely conscientious person; Mother is more laid back<br>
		Nurture's influence on trait: Asian culture and values has pushed me to be more hardworking<br>
		Analysis of trait: Conscientiousness is one of the 5 Big Personality traits that reflects thoroughfulness, carefulness, and vigilance. 
		With this online test, I scored around 80% (0%-least conscientious; 100% most conscientious).
		My parents also took the test; my mother scored 70%, and my father scored 85%. <i>(note: As I have mentioned in the previous section for
		neuroticism, I am not taking these numbers at face value. However, they give me a general sense of how my parents and I compare to 
		other individuals.)</i> As mentioned before, conscientiousness has a slighly lower heritability index compared to the other behavioral traits.
		This may primarily be because conscientiousness affects the overall social 'fitness' of a person. For the human
		species, the more conscientious, and therefore more hardworking, are more likely to succeed. 
		Hence, people learn instantaneously to adapt to become more conscientious and hardworking people. It's interesting
		to see how social factors motivate people to change some of their behavioral traits.
