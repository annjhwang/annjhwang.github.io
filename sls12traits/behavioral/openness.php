		Heritability of trait: <a href="http://download.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/static/pdf/944/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1012294324713.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012294324713&token2=exp=1481226396~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F944%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1012294324713.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1012294324713*~hmac=db261d3e5f344f06dcafa1e4fee964399b3a206d5c4ca6b9b7d94c3421799a81">0.45-0.61<a><br>
		Nature's Influence: Father has always been adventuruous and open to new experiences<br>
		Nurture's influence: Past experiences and mentors have encouraged me to be more open to new ideas/experiences <br>
		Analysis of trait: Openness is another one of the 5 Big Personalities that is related to how "open" as person is to
		new experiences, ideas, and values. Individuals that score highly one Openness tend to be
		more curious, imaginative, and open-minded. The openness score I received was 81%. Interestingly,
		my parents both scored around 60%. This can be attributed to the fact that personality traits change over years.
		Older people could be less excited with the idea of new things due to a general decrease in curiosity 
		(because they already have much more experiences). Hence, though the initial heritablity index of an adoloscent
		or young adult could be relatively high, it is also influenced by social factors like past experiences.
