		Heritability: <a href="http://www.nature.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/ng/journal/v42/n7/full/ng.608.html">Around 0.8<a><br>
		Nature's Influence: Parents are both short (dad:5'6'', mom:5'2'') <br>
		Nurture's Influence: Sleeping habits, nutrition, execercise<br>
		Analysis: Many recent studies have shown the human height has a fairly high heritability index of around 0.8. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3EF884AEA534C90F46F95C9FA3944C84/S1369052300004001a.pdf/div-class-title-heritability-of-adult-body-height-a-comparative-study-of-twin-cohorts-in-eight-countries-div.pdf"> This particular European study</a>
		analyzed the effect affluence has on the genetic architecture of body height. The study showed that the environmental factors on men, especially, were minimal.
		This highlights the fact that this specific nurture component (affluence) does not greatly affect the height of an individual. What was interesting, however, was
		the difference in the height variation between these different European countries. For example, the average height for men in Italy is 177cm, while the average height for men in Netherlands
		is 184cm. This is particularly interesting, considering that the actual genetic makeup between different European countries would be very similar, because they all come from Caucasian descent.
		This could possibly mean that different environmental factors in within these countries are also causing the difference in mean height. Although the exact reason
		for this mean height discrepancy is unclear, it is evident that one's genetic makeup, and thus ethnic background, has a big role in determining one's height. Hence, looking back at
		my whole family members' heights, it is not surprising that we are all rather more petite Asian men/women/girls/boys. Though I usually slept early, maintained a healthy diet, and exercised
		regularly, my genetic makeup that I've inherited from my parents seemed to trump these efforts to become taller. In a more high level interpretation of this data, this may mean that it is more likely 
		for a child that has an unhealthy nutritional diet with tall parents to still end up being tall than a child that has a healthy nutritional diet with short parents end up being tall.
