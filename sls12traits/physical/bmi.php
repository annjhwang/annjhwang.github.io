		My BMI: 22 (healthy)<br>
		Heritability: <a href="http://www.nature.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/ng/journal/v47/n10/full/ng.3390.html">0.3-0.6(studies vary)</a><br>
		Nature's Influence: Mom: 26 (healthy for her age), Dad: 25 (healthy)<br>
		Nurture's influence on trait: Healthy diet, exercise, stress level <br>
		Analysis of trait: I have BMI of 22.0, while my parents have BMIs of around 25. Studies show that BMI has a slightly lower heritability index than most 
		other physical traits (i.e. height that has a heritability
		index of around 0.8). Although many studies have also shown that BMI is also highly dependent on race (therefore Nature), many "nurture" factors like eating habits and 
		frequency of exercise could really influence one's body mass index. It's really ironic, however, that these traits (eatin habits)
		that we would initially think of as Nurture are most likely affected by Nature's effect on personality traits that
		we partly inherit from our parents. For example, individuals with
		a low self-disicpline value, which has a relatively high heritablity index <a href="http://download.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/static/pdf/944/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1012294324713.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012294324713&token2=exp=1481226396~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F944%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1012294324713.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1012294324713*~hmac=db261d3e5f344f06dcafa1e4fee964399b3a206d5c4ca6b9b7d94c3421799a81"

		to exercise regularly and eat moderately. By examining this specific trait, we can see that it is impossible
		to completely separate the effects of Nature and Nurture because they are inherently interdependent.
