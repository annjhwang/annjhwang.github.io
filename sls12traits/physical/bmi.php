		Heritability: <a href="http://www.nature.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/ng/journal/v47/n10/full/ng.3390.html">0.3-0.6(studies vary)</a><br>
		Nature's Influence: Mom has BMI of around 26 (healthy for her age), Dad: 25 (healthy)<br>
		Nurture's influence on trait: Healthy diet, exercise, stress level <br>
		Analysis of trait: I have BMI of 22.0, while my parents have BMIs of around 25. Studies show that BMI has a slightly lower heritability index than most 
		other physical traits (i.e. height that has a heritability
		index of around 0.8). This is particularly because various "nurture" factors like eating and exercising habits are key influencers for
		one's body mass index. However, the reason the heritability score isn't lower is because these factors that we would initially think of as
		"nurture" are most likely influenced by other behavioral traits we may have that have a higher heritability score. For example, individuals with
		a low self-disicpline value, which has a relatively high heritablity index <a href="http://download.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/static/pdf/944/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1012294324713.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012294324713&token2=exp=1481226396~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F944%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1012294324713.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1012294324713*~hmac=db261d3e5f344f06dcafa1e4fee964399b3a206d5c4ca6b9b7d94c3421799a81"
		>(0.28)</a> for a behavioral trait, would most likely have a higher BMI. Hence, it is 
		very hard to distinguish between nurture's and nature's influence on traits like BMI, because they are inherently interdependent. BMI is also race
		and sex dependent, which also highlights nature's effect on BMI.
