		<p>My Dimples: I have a dimple only on my right cheek<br>
			Heritability: <a href="http://omim.org/entry/126100">Highly heritable (no definite score given)</a><br>
		   Nature's Influence: Father has dimples, mother does not<br>
		   Nurture's Influence: None<br>
		   Analysis: I have a single dimple on my right cheek. Dimples are known to be fairly heritable. The presence of dimples is known to be dominant,
		   while the absence of it is recessive. Dimples are actually known to be an "irregular" dominant trait, which means that having two parents with dimples does
		   not always 100% guarantee the presence of dimples in the child. Studies also show that just one gene affects the transfer of dimples from parents to children. This specifc gene is found in the sex cells before the process of reproduction, one
		   allele coming from each parent. Hence, in the case that both parents have dimples, there is around 50-100% chance that the children will also have dimples. On the other hand,
		   if only one of the parents have dimples, there is a roughly 50% probability of the child having dimples. Lastly, in the case that neither parents have dimples,
		   the probabily of the child having dimples drops down to around 0%.My dad has dimples, while my mother does not. My two brothers do not have dimples, while I
		   have one dimple on my right cheek. It is not surprising that only 1/3 of us have dimples, considering that only my dad has dimples, and dimples are an irregular dominant
		   trait.
