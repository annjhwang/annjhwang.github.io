		Heritability of trait: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/science/article/pii/S0012369216373779">0.4-0.7</a><br>
		Nature's Influence: Father had asthma at a young age<br>
		Nurture's influence: Second-hand smoking, air pollution, dusty/unclean environement<br>
		Analysis of trait: Asthma is one of the most common chronic allergic diseases found in children. Up until I reached the age of 10, I personally
		suffered from asthma as well. Various studies in the past have reasoned that heritability of asthma ranges from around 0.4 to 0.7. Though asthma
		is highly dependent on genetics, it is also effected by aspects of nurture such as air pollution and general cleanliness of an environment.
		It is important to highlight that, similar to eczema, asthma has a higher heritability index and frequency in children than in adults. This is largely
		due to the fact that both asthma and eczema are partially caused by weaker immunologic defenses and/or allergic reactions. Since most children do not
		have a strong immune system, nor a near-comprehensive knowledge about what allergies they have, it is reasonable that these diseases are more common in children.
		Hence, we could justify that nurture also has a prominent influence on one's likelihood of having asthma, especially as an adult.
